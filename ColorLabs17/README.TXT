1) Who critiqued me and what was their critique

**Evan Hader:** Said to maybe add another bucket to add detail to Richard's pants; I already have 5 buckets I don't need more
**Richard Zhang:** Said that there was too much yellow and need I should balance it out with the blue and purple; already tried that initially but that's actually a good idea and it makes it more balanced
